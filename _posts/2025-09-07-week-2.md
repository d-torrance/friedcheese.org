title: college football poll -- week 2
---

It's college football season, baby!  That means it's time to start up the friedcheese.org "Coefficient of Relationship" college football poll!

As a reminder, this is how it works.  If your team beats someone, then they get 1 win.  If they beat someone who beat someone, then they get 1/2 win.  If they beat someone who beat someone who beat someone, then they get 1/4 win, and so on.  We then add up all these "wins", subtract the corresponding "losses", and rank the teams accordingly.

Of course, early in the season, there's almost no data and the poll is pretty much trash, but here we go anyway!

Ole Miss starts the season in the top spot by virtue of beating Kentucky yesterday, but Kentucky beat Toledo in week 1, who beat Western Kentucky yesterday, who beat Sam Houston in week 0.  Adding their win over Georgia State last week, that's 2.875 "wins"!
